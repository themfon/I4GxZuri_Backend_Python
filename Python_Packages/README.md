[Rock-Paper-Scissors Game]
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules.

A Brief Summary:
If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper

This is a simple version of this game with Python that makes use of the inbuilt Python module random and its choice method. In this version, one player is controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the user (i.e CPU vs Player). 

"R" for "rock", 
"P" for "paper", 
"S" for "scissors".

When the program is run, the user is asked to pick an option between "R", "P" or "S".
If user input is invalid (not amongst the options), it prints an error, and asks for their input again.
If there is a winner, it prints the winner, and the program ends. 
If it's a tie (the computer and player pick the same move), user is prompted to pick an option again.

Enjoy.
